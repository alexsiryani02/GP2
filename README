To initiate the website, you need to follow these steps: THIS MUST BE RUNNING ON T4 GPU for better efficiency.

When opening Colab, you should write the following commands in the main.ipynb:

The first line is for installing Streamlit.
The second line is for setting your password for the website (IP address).
The third line is for running the app.

Before executing the third command, you should create a file in the 'Files' section called 'lstm_arima.py', Copy the code 
written in lstm_arima.py into this file.

After creating the file, run the third command. This will provide you with two URLs. After approximately 20 seconds, 
a third URL will be generated.

You should use the third URL by clicking on it, which will lead you to a new website requesting a local tunnel password.

Use the password you set with the second command. After entering the password, the website will start running.

It will take almost 45-60 seconds to start. Once running, the stock AAPL will be predicted using LSTM and the ARIMA model. 

Then, you can search for any stock ticker you want, ty for example (MSFT or TSLA)
